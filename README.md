## The Cooper Challenge
### Author: Becca Burns & Alex Saxena

The Cooper Challenge project is a full stack application that allows users to check current and previous results of their aerobic fitness measured by the cooper test. To perform the test the athlete must run at high intensity for 12 minutes. Once completed, the user will inpu the distance, age and gender for the result.

The backend(API) was build on Ruby on Rails and the front-end was build on ReactJS. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Users can visit the deployed app [here](cooperchallenge.netlify.com).
(Note: For the app to run properly accessing the API please fork the API repository [here](https://github.com/beccaburns/Cooper_App/tree/development/cooper_api) and run it with the rails s command.)
